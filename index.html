<p>I am a Post-doctoral researcher at the Centre for Sustainability at the Hertie School. Before joining Hertie, I was a Visiting Assitant in Research at the Yale Program on Climate Change at Yale University, a doctoral candidate at the Scripts Centre of Excellence at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and a MPhil Candidate at St Anton'y College in Oxford.</p>
<p>In my work I use quantitative methods such as causal inference and predictive modlling/machine learning to analyse climate politics</p>.
