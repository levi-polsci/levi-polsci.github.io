<p>I am a Post-doctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/sustainability" target="blank">Centre for Sustainability</a> at Hertie School. Before joining Hertie, I was a Visiting Assitant in Research at <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu" target="blank">Yale University</a>, a doctoral candidate at the <a href="https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/" target="blank">Scripts Centre of Excellence</a> at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and a MPhil Candidate at St Anthony's College at the <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="blank">University of Oxford</a>.</p>
<p>I conceptualize, execute, and supervise research project that apply quantitative and computational methods to analyse climate and environmental politics. In my work I frequently draw on techniques such as causal inference and machine learning to model the formation of political preferences and to analyze how socio-economic circumstances influence the adoption of economic and environmental policies.</p>
<p>My research has been published as scientific articles in peer reviewed journals such as <i>Energy Research and Social Science</i> or the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia on Climate Science</i>. It has also informed several public talks and media articles on climate change and has led to several policy papers published for the German energy transision program <i>Ariadne</i>.</p>
