<p>I am a political scientist and climate policy expert with the <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/sustainability" target="blank">Centre for Sustainability</a> at Hertie School in Berlin, Germany. Before joining Hertie, I have been a Visiting Assistant in Research at <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu" target="blank">Yale University</a>, a doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/" target="blank"> at Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a>, and an MPhil candidate at the <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="blank">University of Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>My work focuses on political opinion formation, policy onset, and policy feedback, mostly in the field of climate change politics. Here, I frequently apply quantitative techniques such as causal inference and machine learning and often take a cross-national comparative perspective. 
  
 <p> In my PhD thesis, I have analyzed the formation of climate change attitudes across different countries using a quantitaive anaysis of global survey data and qualitative process-tracing based on fieldwork in Germany, South Africa, and Argentina.</p>

<p>My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as <i>Environmental Politics</i>, <i>Global Environmental Politics</i> or <i>Energy Research and Social Science</i>. Besides academic research, I also write policy papers and consult political decision-makers and other stakeholders.</p>
