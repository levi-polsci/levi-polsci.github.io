<p>I am a Post-doctoral researcher at the Centre for Sustainability at the Hertie School. Before joining Hertie, I was a Visiting Assitant in Research at the Yale Program on Climate Change at Yale University, a doctoral candidate at the Scripts Centre of Excellence at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and a MPhil Candidate at St Anthon'y College in Oxford.</p>
<p>In my work I use quantitative methods to analyse climate and environmental politics. Applying techniques such as causal inference and predictive modlling/machine learning I examine the formation of political preferences and how socio-economic circumstances influence the adoption of policies.</p>.
<p>My research is published in international-peer reviewed outlets such as Energy Research and Social Science or the Oxford Encyclopedia on Climate Science. It has also informed several public talks and media articles on climate change and has led to several policy papers published for the German energy transision program <i>Ariadne</i>.</p>
