<p>I am a Post-doctoral researcher with the <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/sustainability" target="blank">Centre for Sustainability</a> at Hertie School in Berlin, Germany. Before joining Hertie, I have been a Visiting Assistant in Research at <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu" target="blank">Yale University</a>, a doctoral candidate at <a href="https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/" target="blank"> at Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a>, and an MPhil Candidate at the <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="blank">University of Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>I conduct and supervise research projects that use quantitative and computational methods to analyze  political decisions, mostly in the field of climate change politics. My work  applies techniques such as causal inference and machine learning to examine the formation of political preferences and the influence of socio-economic conditions on the adoption of economic and environmental policies.</p>

<p>My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as <i>Energy Research and Social Science</i> or the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia on Climate Science</i>. Besides academic research, I also write policy papers and consult political decision-makers and other stakeholders.</p>
