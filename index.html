<p>I am a political scientist and climate policy expert with the <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/sustainability" target="blank">Centre for Sustainability</a> at Hertie School in Berlin, Germany. Before joining Hertie, I have been a Visiting Assistant in Research at <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu" target="blank">Yale University</a>, a doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/" target="blank"> at Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a>, and an MPhil candidate at the <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="blank">University of Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>My research analyzes political opinion formation, policy onset, and policy feedback, mostly in the field of climate change politics. My work  frequently applies quantitative techniques such as causal inference, machine learning, and geospatial analysis and often takes a cross-national perspective. 
  
 <p> In my PhD thesis, I have analyzed the formation of climate change attitudes across different countries using a quantitaive anaysis of global survey data and qualitative process-tracing in Germany, South Africa, and Argentina.</p>

<p>My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as <i>Global Environmental Politics</i>, <i>Energy Research and Social Science</i> or the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia on Climate Science</i>. Besides academic research, I also write policy papers and consult political decision-makers and other stakeholders.</p>
