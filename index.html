<p>I am a Post-doctoral researcher with the <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/sustainability" target="blank">Centre for Sustainability</a> at Hertie School. Before joining Hertie, I was a Visiting Assitant in Research at <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu" target="blank">Yale University</a>, a doctoral candidate at the <a href="https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/" target="blank">Scripts Centre of Excellence</a> at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and a MPhil Candidate at St Anthony's College at the <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="blank">University of Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>I conduct and supervise research project that apply quantitative and computational methods to analyse political decisions, mostly in the field of climate politics. In my work I draw on techniques such as causal inference and machine learning to examine the formation of political preferences and to analyze the influence of socio-economic conditions on the adoption of economic and environmental policies.</p>

<p>My research has been published in peer reviewed journals such as <i>Energy Research and Social Science</i> or the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia on Climate Science</i> Besides academic research I contribute to policy papers and consult political decision makers and other stakeholders.</p>
