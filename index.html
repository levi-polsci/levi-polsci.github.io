<p>I am a Post-doctoral researcher with the <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/sustainability" target="blank">Centre for Sustainability</a> at Hertie School. Before joining Hertie, I have been a Visiting Assitant in Research at <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu" target="blank">Yale University</a>, a doctoral candidate at the <a href="https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/" target="blank"> at Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a>, and an MPhil Candidate at the <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="blank">University of Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>I conduct and supervise research project that use quantitative and computational methods to analyse political decisions, mostly relating to climate change politics. My work thereby applies techniques such as causal inference and machine learning to examine the formation of political preferences and the influence of socio-economic conditions on the adoption of economic and environmental policies.</p>

<p>My research has been published in peer reviewed journals such as <i>Energy Research and Social Science</i> or the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia on Climate Science</i>. Besides academic research I write policy papers and consult political decision makers and other stakeholders.</p>
